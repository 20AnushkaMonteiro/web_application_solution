## what is the project
 
The questions that I am looking to solve is to help Solent University students to be mindful of the events taking place in university. When a young adult starts university, it seems like everything is overwhelming, to start lectures and events that are taking place at the start of the academic year whilst also trying to get used to the social jump from secondary education to higher. The university has been organizing different events that are taking place to help the students adjust with their new life with terms like Harvard referencing, lecture and literature review etc. when they already have a drastic change by moving away from home.  
Which is why the project is based on meeting the user needs. A ‘user-centered approach’ for the student by using a non-linear nature of design thinking process, in which the surveys and interviews will guide the process of rapid prototyping from the collected information during the entire assignment as this will help picture the idea visually.
At the ideate stage, I will be working to create a prototype with features like finding events in the local area, sorting and filtering categories to help the user find what they are looking for in a few clicks rather than scrolling through all of the information provided. When the user clicks on the event they are interested in, it will redirect the user to a new page where all the information is regarding the events. 

## what the project
the project is an application to help student find event in the locality thought their university to be able to adjust to their new uni life style.
