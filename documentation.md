# Introduction
The problems statement that was being solve was to help students at Solent University be aware of the activities taking place at the university. The project is focused on satisfying the needs of the customer. A 'user-centered approach' for the student, leveraging the non-linear aspects of the design thinking process. At the stage of the ideate, I'm working on building a prototype of functionality such as locating activities in the local region, sorting and searching categories to help the user locate what they're searching for in a few taps, rather than browsing through all the information offered. As mentioned in the first assignment about the idea following it in this assignment it will be used to develop the medium fidelity prototype.  

# Methodology
During the prototyping and implementation stage, the method that will be used is waterfall approach as this will help me set goals for each step of the process and manage it in that stage before moving to the next process. 
the waterfall approach is the most common method of designing applications. This approach is a rigid linear model composed of consecutive steps based on distinct targets. Each process must be fully finished before the next phase can begin. Typically, there is no mechanism to go back to change the project or direction.
The first stage of the waterfall model is ‘Requirements’ in this stage the assignment 1 user requirement document will be taking and developed to meet the user’s requirement. Users like to locate all the details in one location, although some users just like to get email updates. They would also like to know the activities that social media are taking place at the university, since these are the channels on which they are more involved. Students also like to get an insight into the various courses of activities. [Synopsys. 2019](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/top-4-software-development-methodologies/)

the second design stage has been already taken place in assignment 1 where I designed a medium fidelity design a clickable prototype as it defined the general design of the system. 

The next stage is implementation with system design inputs, the system will be first built-in small modules, which are implemented in the next step. Each unit is planned and tested for its functionality. For this project there will be 6 modules which is defined for each page link. 
* The first Phases will be ‘Home_page’ where the student will be able to filter and search all the events that are taking place in their interest. As this will give them change to be more involved in the locality whereas gain more knowledge in the fields and meet student with the same interest. 
* The second Phases will be ‘filtered page’ where the students will be able to view more events in their interest. And also use filters to make a deeper search. 
* The third Phases will be ‘more information on the event selected page’ where the user will be able to get more information like time, date, location. On that page the user will also be able to share the event using the social media links on the bottom of the page.
* The fourth Phases/ step is ‘payment’ when the user would like to book an event they liked if the event was with admission fee, they would be required to make a payment using the payment form to place the order to receive their ticket. If it was free event it would require them to just sign into the platform and book a place whereas if they are already login it, they would just have to click on the place order button to book a place.
* The 5th Phases will be order/ booking confirmation. Where the user will receive a screen as well as email confirmation about the event they have booked. 
* The sixth Phases will be ‘favorite’. Where the user will be to view all their liked event that they might be interested to visit to in the future. 

# Methods
The data for the profile will be collected using the real-time database. As there will be a list of data it will be used to store in firebase database using ‘var database = firebase.database();’. Using the push() form to connect data to a list of multiple-user programs. Push() produces a specific key every time a new child will be added to the stated Firebase relation. A real-time Database Query class will be used to retrieve data sorted by key, by value, or by value of a child. which can be filtered to sort the result to a specific number of results or a range of keys or values. is offered in the firebase database or I can get the dataset as a .csv file to use python or table to visualize and analyze the dataset.

 During the first assignment I was working to develop a prototype to have a feature that would meet the user’s requirements it was for the Solent university’s student age 18 and over. As during the survey, I figured out that the main reason for a student feeling annoying in university is because of the move to a new city. As some of them do not know any the area which is why they perfect to stay in. the application has been developed to let students search or find actives in their local area to meet new people. The application allows them to sort and browse by categories to let the user find what there are looking for in just a few steps. Rather than sorting through a lot of data. By using the service they will be able to have a short summary of the event that is taking place but if the user required to see more details they will able link the cards which will than redirect them to a new page.

The hyoptoises that would be answered was whether the user would be able to follow task for each screen for example are, they able to book an event using the form and payment method. To see if they can favorite the event they like.

* what the unique feature of the app is 
* what does the user already know about the layout of the application? 
* Are they able to connect the Icon navigation bar 
* Do they know anything about how to book an event?  
* the normal task of signing in/ login 
 
during the task, I would present the task as a scenario to make the user understand what is required from them to be doing and then observe them on how they take the approach. The user will be required to book an event, if chosen a payed event they should be able to use the payment form to pay. Their Favourite events should be all in the linked page, click on their chosen events and view the full details for the event. In this order, the Sequence will ensure a smooth flow of the test session. 

# Conclusion/Results
The pros of using waterfall method in this project has given me the freedom to develop each stage and review the process at the and by testing each feature on the application. this worked well for my project as the requirements were defined at the start on the implementation stage. all the milestones that needed work were set as screens after each element of the screen was completed I was able to test it offline.

Thought out this project I have used React to develop the web application. As a layer of the JavaScript features. React application in this development has been used to create a different component that have been interconnected into app is a component. Which has broken each UI element into a set of section.
